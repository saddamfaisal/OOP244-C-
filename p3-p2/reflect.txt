I learned from this workshop how to define class which contains two types public: 
that we can access data directly from anywhere outside the class.A private: is 
variable or function prevents the members of a struct or a class to be accessible by 
the external functions only could access private by manipulate from function inside the class.
Also,I learned how to I learned how to allocate dynamic memory and why we need to use delete operator
 after allocation dynamic memory to prevent any leak .Then I learn how to declare object of class 
 that help to access data members and member functions in theclass public we access the member function 
by using the (::)the scope resolutionoperrator.Then I learned hoe to access private member of data by
 manipulate the friend function or variables inside the class .In the end I learned the standared
output and libraries that should  be include in each header file and cpp file.
