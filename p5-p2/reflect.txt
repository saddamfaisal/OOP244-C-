What I learned from this project first how to define operator.It is a function with 
special names when you define operator you have to write the word operator then followed 
by the sign of the required operator.The main purpose of using because it enables
your objects to be written in your output as you want .It is kind of unifying  interfaces 
and the important aim for unifying interfaces is polymorphism.The challeng part of this project 
was at the function operator (+=)when I allocate temporary dynamic memory and assigne it to the 
M_engines the siz that one of them one size biger because we add one ,so when you run 
without delete you got leak .In the end; I learned the keyword this the purpose of use 
to access the current executing object of class .The role of using counstructur to initialize
 memory location for the object while destructor to destroy the object.The
class can have more than one counstructor but one destructor.
