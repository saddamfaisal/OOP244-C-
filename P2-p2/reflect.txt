I learned from this workshope about the dynamic memory allocation by declaring pointer
and use the new followed by data type of variable to allocate for variable and followed
by data type and  square bracket for array .The dynamic memory allocate by the user after
that we have to delete it to clear the buffer .Then I learned how to declare struct which 
contain :data member that could be variable from different data types.Also,I learned 
how to access member of arry of struct.The hard part in the project in the wrap function 
when we validate the number of layers and the minimum required layers for gift.Then how 
to choose the pattern.Also ,there is difficult in the unwrap function we have to deallocation 
for wrap to prevent the leak.
