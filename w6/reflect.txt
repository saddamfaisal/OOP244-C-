I learned from this work shop The copy counstructor that the main purpose of use it 

in our project and others to initiize  object with another object of the same type 

We must to use it when we have class with dynamic memory allocation because that 

will help us to reduce rewrittting and improve reusability .The parameters of the copy 

counstructor have to pass by refrence because  the copying will not happen if we pass

by value and the compiler will generat error in case passing by value .ALso, I learned the 

copy assignment operator is similar to copy counstructor in logic .It means assign 

value of object to another both they are excited and does not  require to allocate any memory .

It is anothrer way of copy counstructor . It does self assignment to compare the current object

with the source object.
